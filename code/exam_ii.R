# call packages -----------------------------------------------------------

# Execute the following lines of code to call packages
p_load(tidyverse,
       sf,
       terra,
       exactextractr,
       tidyterra)

# To answer the following questions, use the data below:
df_site <- read_csv("data/data_finsync_nc.csv") %>% 
  distinct(site_id, 
           lon, 
           lat)

sf_nc_county <- readRDS("data/sf_nc_county.rds")

# vector data analysis ----------------------------------------------------

# Q1. 
# `df_site` currently has no coordinate reference system (CRS). 
# Convert it to an `sf` object and assign the WGS 84 CRS (EPSG: 4326). 
# Save the resulting object as `sf_site`.


# Q2.
# From `sf_nc_county`, select only the county polygons of the following counties: 
#   "guilford", "randolph", "davidson", and "forsyth". 
# Save the result as `sf_four`.


# Q3. 
# Perform a spatial join to identify sites in `sf_site` that fall within 
#   the four selected counties stored in `sf_four`. 
# Make sure that the output object is a POINT layer after spatial join.
# Remove any rows without a `county` value and save the result as `sf_site_four`.


# Q4. 
# Create a map showing the four selected counties (`sf_four`) 
#   and the sampling sites (`sf_site_four`) overlaid on the same plot. 


# Q5. 
# Calculate the pairwise distances among all sites in `sf_site_four`
#   with the appropriate CRS, UTM Zone 17N (EPSG: 32617) 
#   so that distances are measured in meters. 
# Then, find the maximum distance among all site pairs.

# raster data analysis ----------------------------------------------------

# Q6. 
# The raster file "spr_land_reclass.tif" in the "data" folder 
#   contains reclassified land-cover data, 
#   where pixel values represent land-cover types as follows:
#   1001 = forest
#   1010 = crop
#   1100 = urban
#   0 = other
# 
# Load this raster as `spr_land` and display the unique land-cover codes it contains.


# Q7. 
# Reclassify the raster `spr_land` to create a new raster object `spr_crop` 
#   that highlights only cropland areas. 
# Use the following reclassification rules:
#   1001 = 0 (forest)
#   1010 = 1 (crop)
#   1100 = 0 (urban)
#   0 = 0 (other)


# Q8. 
# Crop the cropland raster (`spr_crop`) to the extent of the four selected counties 
# (`sf_four`; "guilford", "randolph", "davidson", and "forsyth")
# Save the resulting cropped raster as `spr_crop_four`.


# Q9. 
# Create a map showing the cropped cropland raster (`spr_crop_four`) 
#   overlaid with the four counties (`sf_four`). 
# Use a semi-transparent overlay for the counties.


# Q10. Calculate the proportion of cropland pixels within the four counties 
#   from the cropped raster (`spr_crop_four`). 
# Since cropland pixels are coded as 1 and others as 0, the mean gives the proportion.

# (round your answer to third decimal places, e.g., 0.021)


# raster-vector interaction -----------------------------------------------

# Q11.
# The raster file "spr_tmp_nc.tif" in the "data" folder contains 
#   annual mean temperature (°C) data for North Carolina. 
# Load this raster and extract the temperature values 
#   at each sampling site in `sf_site`. 
# Then, identify how many sites have temperature values greater than 16°C.
#
# ENTER YOUR ANSWER HERE:


# Q12. Create 3-km buffers around each site in `sf_site_four` (see Q3). 
# Be sure to first transform the coordinate reference system to UTM Zone 17N (EPSG: 32617) 
# so that the buffer distance is measured in meters.


# Q13. Project the cropped cropland raster (`spr_crop_four`) 
# to the same UTM coordinate reference system (EPSG: 32617). 
# Use an appropriate re-sampling method in light of the raster data type.


# Q14. Create a map displaying the projected cropland raster (`spr_crop_proj`) 
# with 3-km site buffers (`sf_buff_proj`) overlaid.


# Q15. Calculate the proportion of cropland within each 3-km site buffer. 
# Store the result as `df_crop_frac`, and identify the `site_id` 
# with the highest cropland fraction.
